# Tailscale in Docker without elevated privileges

See associated blog post: <https://asselin.engineer/tailscale-docker>

**Set the TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY with your own ephemeral auth key**: <https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys>

The `Makefile` contains all commands to launch the various examples. Refer to it to understand which commands are used.

## docker-compose

By default, no state is saved. The nodes are removed from the network when the tailscale container is terminated. This means the ip address is never the same.
The `stateful-example` does save the tailscale node state to a docker volume.

Usage:
````bash
export TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY="your-key"
# set which project is used
export PROJECT_DIRECTORY="docker-compose/simple-example"
# Sart with rebuild if necessary:
docker-compose --project-directory=${PROJECT_DIRECTORY} up -d --build
# Show logs and tail (follow):
docker-compose --project-directory=${PROJECT_DIRECTORY} logs --follow
# Stop:
docker-compose --project-directory=${PROJECT_DIRECTORY} down
````

### simple-example

As explained in the blog post, uses a docker-compose service to add the container in the VPN.

### complex-example

Not complex but more complex than the simple-example.
A nginx layer is added. It manages two services in independent containers at urls `/service-one` and `/service-two`.

### stateful-example

Same as simple-example but uses a volume to save state. The goal is to be able to reuse the same tailscale hostname _and ip address_.
Useful in situations where the tailscale magic DNS cannot be used.

## K8S

Same as the simple-example but on kubernetes.

Requirements:

- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installing-with-a-package-manager)
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

Usage:
````bash
# Create cluster
kind create cluster --name tailscale
kubectl get nodes
# Deploy tailscale and demo webpage:
kubectl apply -f k8s/simple-example/deployment.yaml
# Delete cluster:
kind delete cluster --name tailscale
````
